I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Warwick, UK, working with Professor [Oleg Pikhurko](https://pikhurko.github.io/).

From August 2020 to April 2025, I was a research fellow in the Extremal Combinatorics and Probability Group, led by Professor [Hong Liu](https://www.ibs.re.kr/ecopro/hongliu/), at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Daejeon, South Korea.

Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. in the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), under the supervision of Professor [Jie Ma](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jiema/). I received my B.S. degree in 2017 from the School of the Gifted Young at USTC.

Research Interests:
======
I am interesting in Combinatorics, Graph Theory (both extremal and structural), Extremal Set Theory, discrete geometry, and their applications to Computer Science.
